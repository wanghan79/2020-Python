To Doctor.Wang

First off, I am hankering for appreciating for Dr.Wang's instructions and patience in course of this entire semester. As a matter of fact, as a cross-disciplinary student, this is my first time to obtain certain understandings of programming and coding. Indeed, computer science and tecchnology is an awesome field and I am clear that I have a long way to go, but fortunately, I've taken my first steps in the right direction thanks to Dr.Wang.

I have ever encountered huge difficulties on Python and spent countless nights trying to find the optimal approach to overcome them. Thankfully, Dr.Wang was so supportive and gave me numerous guidence, inspirations and encouragement. With the help of Dr.Wang, I could identify each minor outlier and resolve potential problems with ease. And in retrospect, I really embrace this course of learning, and Python actually could exert positive effects on my own major such as data analysis and visualization. 

From my perspective,  I do not tend to dabble in computer science and technology, so apart from cherishing this wonderful adventure, I will do my utmost to cultivate more computer skills in the future and explore it unceasingly. 

Sincerely,
Dngyuan Xu
